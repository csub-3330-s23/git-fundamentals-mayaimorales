# What I learned in the Github overview ‚úèÔ∏è

## Summary üìã

### Github is a form of source control that utilizes a series of features such as branches, issues, forks, cloning and markdown files to be able to successfully collaborate on a project and keep track of the changes being made.

## Get it or don't get it? ü§î

#### I had an extensive time over last spring semester to learn Github all on my own and got a very good understanding of it. I utilized the commandline to clone down all my repos to my local machine and then I would work and commit to main.
#### I had to work collaboratively on mulitple projects and have a good understanding of working on different branches, merging to main through pull requests, and resolving merge conflicts.

# I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT IN MY GITHUB SKILLS!
